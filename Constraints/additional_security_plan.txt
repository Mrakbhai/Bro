I’ll deliver a finalized step-by-step design and tech stack that covers everything: HLS + re-encryption for cacheability, encrypted manifests, thumbnails (including GIFs), handling images/audio/txt, chunked client upload, key derivation & IV rules for caching friendliness, sizes/parameters, and operational notes for low-end server.

I’ll break it into sections: 1) High-level pipeline, 2) Artifacts & storage layout, 3) Key/IV derivation and manifest encryption (caching friendliness), 4) Upload strategy & chunking, 5) Server processing (workers/cores/queue), 6) Formats & per-media handling (video, gif, images, audio, text), 7) Playback & client responsibilities, 8) Security & operational best practices, 9) Parameter summary (concrete values), and 10) deployment / monitoring notes.

1) High-level pipeline

1. Group key established
A group content passphrase/key is agreed among the friends (out-of-band). From that passphrase clients derive group_master_key (KDF). Server may also hold this key, or it can unwrap it if needed.

2. Client-side upload encryption
Client encrypts the upload in streaming/chunked fashion with group_master_key to prevent Cloudflare/Tunnel from seeing plaintext. Chunks are uploaded sequentially (4–16 MiB chunk size recommended).

3. Server receives encrypted upload
Server decrypts (or writes encrypted blob and decrypts offline) using group_master_key to a temporary plain file in a staging folder.

4. Server queues processing job
A background worker picks the job (throttled concurrency) and runs ffmpeg to transcode/segment for streaming.

5. Server processes video into HLS/fMP4 segments
Produce segments (4–10s each; 6s recommended) and a segment manifest (JSON or .m3u8).

6. Server re-encrypts final segments with content key
Derive a stable content_key from group_master_key via HKDF so that ciphertext is identical across viewers (deterministic per segment IV derivation). Encrypt each segment with AES-GCM, store ciphertext files.

7. Server creates & encrypts manifest + thumbnails
Create a manifest JSON listing segments, durations, content IDs, and IVs (or derivation rule). Encrypt whole manifest with the same content_key (AES-GCM) before storing/serving. Generate thumbnails (jpg) and encrypt them with content_key.

8. Store artifacts (encrypted segments, encrypted manifest, enc. thumbnails) in a per-video folder
Publish metadata record (video_id, public info) to DB. Notify uploader that processing has started.

9. Viewer fetch + play
Viewer requests manifest (encrypted), derives content_key locally from passphrase, decrypts manifest, then fetches encrypted segments, decrypts each on the fly in browser (WebCrypto), append to MSE (or use HLS player if you choose fMP4/hls.js approach), and show thumbnails (decrypted).

2) Storage layout (recommended)

Organize files per video id for easy life-cycle management and caching.

/storage/videos/
  <video_id>/
    segments/
      seg_000.enc
      seg_001.enc
      ...
    manifest.enc        # encrypted JSON manifest (includes segment list)
    thumb.jpg.enc        # encrypted default thumbnail (or variants)
    preview.mp4.enc      # optional short preview
    meta.json            # minimal public metadata: {video_id, date, owner_id}

Keep a separate DB/JSON mapping for user ownership, upload status, processing status, and salts/KDF metadata (but do not store plaintext content_key if you want to limit server access)

3) Key derivation, IV derivation, and manifest encryption (caching-friendly)

This section is critical: how to make encrypted segments identical across viewers (so CDN caching works) while being secure.

A. Key derivation

Input: user/group passphrase (high entropy if possible) or a pre-shared 256-bit key.
Do: content_key = HKDF( salt = group_salt, input_key_material = PBKDF2(passphrase, saltForKDF) )
Or simpler: content_key = HKDF(passphrase || group_salt) but recommended approach is: master = PBKDF2(passphrase, salt1, iter) then content_key = HKDF(master, info="content-key", length=32).
Store: group_salt and KDF parameters (kdf=PBKDF2, iter) in the manifest metadata (not secret).

B. IV derivation — deterministic & unique per segment

For reproducible ciphertext (cacheable) you must determine IV deterministically per segment using content_key:
iv_i = truncate12( HMAC-SHA256(content_key, video_id || ":" || segment_index) )
Truncate to 12 bytes for AES-GCM IV.
This is deterministic, unique for each (video_id, segment_index), and avoids random IVs that would cause different ciphertexts per viewer.
Must ensure never to reuse the same IV for different segments under same key. Using video_id+index ensures uniqueness per segment.

C. Manifest encryption

Manifest JSON (includes segment filenames, durations, IVs optional) should be encrypted with AES-GCM using content_key.
For manifest IV, use deterministic IV too (e.g. truncate12(HMAC(content_key, video_id || ":manifest"))) OR a random IV stored alongside the encrypted manifest — either is fine. If you use random IV, store it plaintext in DB for clients.
Manifest encryption gives Cloudflare zero visibility into segment ordering / file names, protecting metadata too.

D. Per-small-blob encryption (images, gifs, txt)

Use AES-GCM with a per-blob IV:
For cacheability, if you want identical ciphertexts across viewers, derive IV deterministically per blob similar to segments.
For small items you can store base64(iv + ciphertext) in DB or files.

4) Client upload strategy & chunk sizes

Goal: avoid too high memory on client and be robust on varying devices.
Chunking approach
Read file via File.slice() or stream API.
Use chunk size: 4 MiB to 16 MiB (4 MiB is safest for low-end clients; 8–16 MiB better for speeds).

For each chunk:

Encrypt chunk with AES-GCM using an upload key (can be same as group key). Use per-chunk random IVs during upload OR deterministic IVs tied to chunk index if you want reconstructable uploaded ciphertext. Save IV alongside chunk metadata.
Upload chunk sequentially (POST) or via resumable upload protocol (range/Content-Range). Sequential is simpler.

Why chunk upload (benefits)

Keeps memory usage low (only one chunk buffered).
Simpler retry model: re-upload failed chunk rather than whole file.
Resume ability: store uploaded chunk indices on server.

Upload tips

Use Content-Range style or a simple chunked protocol /upload?video=tmpid&part=i.
Ensure server writes decrypt/append to disk as it receives chunk to avoid holding the whole file in RAM.
If clients encrypt before upload, server must have key to decrypt per-chunk on the fly or store encrypted full blob and decrypt later.

5) Server-side processing, multi-core use & job queue

Server is low-end, but ffmpeg is CPU bound. Use careful job management.

A. Job queue model
Simple disk-backed queue (sufficient for low-end machines): store jobs as small JSON files in queue/ and have a worker process poll them. This avoids adding Redis/Celery complexity.
Lightweight queue workers: spawn N worker processes (N = number of cores you want to use for ffmpeg). Since ffmpeg is CPU heavy, typically set N = min(1, available_cores-1) on low-end server. On a Snapdragon 425 device, use N=1 or N=2 only with care.
Use ffmpeg -threads 1 inside each job to avoid oversubscription, or tune threads per job.

B. Use separate process (not thread)
Use separate processes for ffmpeg to avoid Python GIL and to isolate memory. Each worker spawns ffmpeg as a subprocess — ideal.
Example: have a master process (Flask) accept uploads and enqueue jobs; a pool of 1-2 worker processes run ffmpeg jobs from the queue.

C. Resource management
Throttle concurrency: limit number of simultaneous ffmpeg runs (1).
Disk I/O: heavy if many simultaneous jobs — ensure there is enough disk bandwidth and free space.
nice/ionice: run ffmpeg with nice and ionice to reduce system impact on interactive services.
Swap caution: try to avoid swap thrashing on 2 GB RAM. Limit ffmpeg memory usage and queue longer jobs.

D. Background tasks & notifications
During processing, update DB status: processing and estimate ETA (size / typical processing speed) after some seconds, avoid updating rapidly and precisely to save resources. Notify uploader via websocket/message when starting tell them that you upload has started it will take some time to process.

6) Media-specific handling (detailed)

Video (primary flow)

Processing:
On server, decrypt original (if encrypted) and create:
HLS with fMP4 segments (CMAF) OR HLS with TS segments. I recommend fMP4 (modern, MSE friendly).
Segment duration: 4–10s (6s recommended for balance).
Create a per-segment file and a manifest.

Final encryption:
Re-encrypt each segment with content_key using deterministic IVs (as outlined).
Encrypt manifest JSON.

Thumbnails:

Extract a thumbnail (ffmpeg -ss frame) before encrypting. Encrypt thumbnail(s) with content_key.
Storage: per-video folder, segmented files, encrypted.

GIFs

GIFs are typically large for long animations and not efficient. Options:
Convert to a MP4 (H.264) for thumbnails. MP4 is streamable and smaller in the same videos encrypted way.
Always generate a static thumbnail (jpg) for gallery listing; encrypt that.

Images (photos)

Encrypt entire file as one blob with AES-GCM and store photo.jpg.enc. Use deterministic IV derivation (video_id or file_id) if you want caching across viewers.

Audio

Audio may remain unencrypted. If so, serve as normal unencrypted file (range streaming works). You can still obfuscate filenames and keep metadata encrypted.

7) Playback & client responsibilities

Manifest fetch: client fetches manifest.enc, derives content_key, decrypts manifest with WebCrypto. Manifest reveals segment list and IVs OR provides IV derivation rule.
Segment fetch: fetch seg_XXX.enc as ArrayBuffer, decrypt with AES-GCM (WebCrypto) using content_key and supplied IV, append to MSE buffer for playback.
Thumb fetch: fetch thumb.jpg.enc, decrypt and create blob: URL for img.src.
Prefetching: keep a small prefetch buffer of 2–4 segments.
Retry & fallback: implement retries for segment fetch / decryption; fallback to full file download if streaming fails.

8) Security & operational concerns (what to take care of)

IV safety: never reuse the same IV for the same key across different data. The derivation scheme ensures uniqueness for segments.
Authenticated encryption: always use AES-GCM (or AES-CTR + HMAC) so ciphertext tampering is detected.
Key secrecy: treat group passphrase with caution.
KDF parameters: choose PBKDF2 iterations with client performance in mind. Document KDF metadata in DB/manifest so clients know how to derive key.
Manifest protection: encrypt the manifest; if manifest is plaintext, it leaks structure.
Logging: avoid logging sensitive values (IVs okay; keys must never be logged). Mask logs that touch file contents.
Backups: back up salts & manifests, but keep keys out of backups if you aim to restrict server access.
Quota and abuse control: limit upload sizes, rate limit uploads per user to prevent denial-of-service or accidental overload.
Disk cleanup: implement lifecycle rules to remove temp plain file quickly.

9) Concrete parameter recommendations (one place)

KDF: PBKDF2 with SHA-256, iterations = 150,000. Salt length = 16 bytes random. (If clients are powerful and you want more security, 250k or 300k is ok.)
Content key: 256 bits (32 bytes).
HKDF: use HKDF-SHA256 to derive subkeys (content key, HMAC key).
Encryption: AES-GCM-256 (IV = 12 bytes)
IV derivation: iv = truncate12(HMAC-SHA256(content_key, video_id || ":" || segment_index)).
Upload chunk size: 4 MiB ← safe for older mobiles; 8–16 MiB for faster networks/devices.
Segment duration: 6 seconds per segment (4–10s acceptable).
Worker concurrency: 1 ffmpeocess by default on your server; scale toe to 2 only if testing shows acceptable memory and CPU usage. Use ffmpeg -threads 1.
Prefetch buffer on client: 2–4 segments.
Thumbnail size: 320×180 (or responsive sizes: 320/720/1080 variants), store small jpg for gallery listing.
Storage TTL: temp plaintext files deleted immediately after processing.

10) Deployment & monitoring notes

Queue dashboard: to view pending/processing jobs, with retry/cancel on server with maybe a command line program
Health checks: monitor CPU, free RAM, disk usage, ffmpeg failure rate, and job queue length.
Backpressure: if queue grows, reject new uploads or show longer ETA.
Use CDN caching: set Cache-Control: public, max-age=... for encrypted segment files so Cloudflare caches them. Because ciphertexts are identical, caching is safe.
Testing: test with a variety of client devices (iOS/Android/desktop), network conditions, and with corrupted segments to ensure the player recovers.

Final recommended staged plan (what to build first)
1. Implement chunked client upload (encrypted) and server-side assembly & decrypt to plaintext (staging). Show upload progress + processing ETA. (This prevents Cloudflare seeing plaintext during upload.)
2. Implement the simple background queue + single worker that runs ffmpeg to create segments and thumbnails, stores them unencrypted initially.
3. Implement deterministic re-encryption of segments + manifest using content_key and storage layout. Save manifest.enc and seg_*.enc files.
4. Implement client code to decrypt manifest + fetch/decrypt segments and play via MSE (or hls.js with fMP4). Also decode thumbnail.
5. Add multiple workers only if needed — tune concurrency after you have production data on CPU/DISK usage.
